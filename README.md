## Abstract

In an unnamed steampunk-fantasy world, society is perched on the edge of progress—and peril.

For centuries, civilizations have battled for survival and dominance over **energy**, resources, and belief. Now, in the wake of a brief era of peace, fractures are forming again. The world’s fragile harmony is beginning to unravel.

The **governing body** of the civilized world, once unified, has splintered into **two dominant factions**, both locked in a cold war for control of the **world’s remaining Snowcrystal reserves**—a rare ethereal resource essential to powering both arcane machines and divine constructs.

Meanwhile, **corporate syndicates** operate in the shadows, pulling political strings and exploiting unrest. In the streets, whispers of resistance spread—**a populist revolution is rising**, challenging not just who holds power, but the very purpose of progress.

You are a group of idealistic teenagers caught in the eye of this storm, uncovering a tangled web of **spiritual, political, and technological warfare**. As the **Clockwork Divide** widens, your party may be the last hope to restore balance—or tip the scales toward chaos.

## Places

### **The Cradle States**
**Lore:**  
The Cradle States are the ancient heart of civilization, where the earliest empires rose and fell. These states were once centers of divine rule and industrial prowess, where the first arcane-tech cities and Snowcrystal-powered machinery were created. The religious orders here have evolved into powerful theocratic-industrial hybrid states, where faith and industry intertwine seamlessly. Each city-state venerates its own patron deity, but the influence of the **Church of the Aetherion** can still be felt in some areas, especially in the more neutral, spiritual factions that oppose the heavy industrialization. 

Despite their prosperity, the Cradle States have grown stagnant over time. The political infighting and religious dogma of the ruling classes have crippled progress, while the common folk suffer under their relentless pursuit of power. There is still much wealth in these lands, and hidden in their cathedrals and steel towers are powerful artifacts—remnants of the old world.

- **Notable Locations:**
  - *Solvannis*: A towering city-state where the Lumen Accord's highest council meets in a grand cathedral made of gold and living crystal. 
  - *Vireon Bastion*: An ancient fortress-city, its walls are said to be reinforced with divine magic, making it nearly impenetrable. 
  - *Othon's Throne*: The seat of the ruling elite, where politics and faith are intricately woven into one.

- **Unique Feature:**  
  Cradle cities are divided by majestic **snowcrystal-powered machines**, often used to manipulate time, light, and even space—keeping the surrounding area in a constant state of renewal.

### **Ashbelt Wastes**
**Lore:**  
Once the battleground of an apocalyptic war between old empires, the Ashbelt Wastes are an expanse of charred earth and half-buried ruins. The land was scarred by great magical and technological battles, and the air is thick with ash and toxic fumes. What was once lush and teeming with life is now a dead and barren expanse—except for the hidden relics of an older age that dot the landscape. Lost machines, power sources, and forgotten technologies lie buried beneath the ash, waiting to be discovered by those brave or desperate enough to seek them.

The Ashbelt is known for being cursed, and few dare to venture here. However, there are rumors of ancient machines still running beneath the wasteland’s surface—mechanical titans capable of altering the course of the world. The people who live near the edges of the Ashbelt are hardened, survivalist types, often bounty hunters, scavengers, or rebels who use the chaos as a backdrop for their underground movements.

- **Notable Locations:**
  - *The Shattered Citadel*: A once-grand metropolis now reduced to rubble, rumored to house ancient Snowcrystal reactors that could alter the world's fate.
  - *The Forgotten Forge*: A colossal, long-abandoned factory complex, filled with twisted steel and magical contraptions from a time long past.
  - *Cinder's Hollow*: A notorious town where scavengers and adventurers trade in dangerous relics from the wastes.

- **Unique Feature:**  
  The **Duststorms**—magical sandstorms—are highly unpredictable. They can carry with them more than just ash; sometimes, they bring fragments of the past, both material and ethereal.

### **Verdant Rise**
**Lore:**  
Verdant Rise is the untamed frontier—a lush, wild region of forests, hills, and untouched natural beauty. It is a land of decentralized communes, free cities, and independent tribes, where the people are fiercely protective of their autonomy and their relationship with nature. Magic here flows naturally, with an abundance of life force in the land that draws out powerful druidic magic and nature-based sorcery. The inhabitants are often agrarian, but also include artisans, hunters, and engineers who live harmoniously with the environment.

Despite its wildness, Verdant Rise has become a refuge for those fleeing the crushing control of the Cradle States and the Forge Concordat. This place is a haven for idealists and rebels, where those seeking freedom from the industrial tyranny can forge new lives. The region is also home to some of the world's most skilled wilderness guides, who know the ancient, mystical paths that connect the old forests and lost cities.

- **Notable Locations:**
  - *Ironroot Hollow*: A forest town built in the roots of a massive, ancient tree. It serves as a meeting point for free-spirited citizens and rebel leaders.
  - *The Eldergrove*: A mystical grove believed to be the last connection to the primal magic of the world, protected by secretive druids.
  - *Skywatch Peaks*: A range of tall mountains where some believe they can commune with celestial forces.  

- **Unique Feature:**  
  The **Living Roads**—mystical paths that appear and disappear at will, leading those who are attuned to nature to hidden areas of power or ancient knowledge.

---

### **The Depths Below**
**Lore:**  
The Depths Below are a vast network of subterranean cities, caverns, and forgotten ruins that exist far beneath the surface. These cities are powered by **Snowcrystal reactors**—dangerous and volatile arcane machines that provide energy but also threaten catastrophic failure. These places are a world of their own, isolated from the surface, with whole communities thriving in the dark. Despite the dangers, the Depths Below have become an economic powerhouse, as the demand for Snowcrystal—harvested from deep veins in the earth—is at an all-time high.

The people of the Depths Below are pragmatic, focused on survival, and often suspicious of surface dwellers. They rely heavily on mechanical technology and arcane magic, living in cities made of steel, stone, and crystal. However, beneath their mechanical expertise lies a fear of the reactors’ eventual collapse. The ruling elite here manipulate the population through the promise of Snowcrystal wealth, but many fear they are living on borrowed time.

- **Notable Locations:**
  - *Redstone Citadel*: The capital city, where the bulk of Snowcrystal production takes place, surrounded by enormous reactor complexes and massive arcane generators.
  - *The Crucible*: A dangerous area where unstable Snowcrystal reactors are tested. Many believe it’s a ticking time bomb.
  - *The Shifting Tunnels*: A labyrinthine system of caves and tunnels that has swallowed many adventurers. Some believe it leads to **the Heart of the Aether**.

- **Unique Feature:**  
  The **Glowstone Crystals**, which illuminate vast stretches of the caverns, but also pulse with strange, unpredictable energy. Some believe the deeper they go, the closer they get to unraveling the secret of the Aether.
