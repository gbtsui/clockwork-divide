## Abstract

In an unnamed steampunk-fantasy world, society is perched on the edge of progress—and peril.

For centuries, civilizations have battled for survival and dominance over **energy**, resources, and belief. Now, in the wake of a brief era of peace, fractures are forming again. The world’s fragile harmony is beginning to unravel.

The **governing body** of the civilized world, once unified, has splintered into **two dominant factions**, both locked in a cold war for control of the **world’s remaining Snowcrystal reserves**—a rare ethereal resource essential to powering both arcane machines and divine constructs.

Meanwhile, **corporate syndicates** operate in the shadows, pulling political strings and exploiting unrest. In the streets, whispers of resistance spread—**a populist revolution is rising**, challenging not just who holds power, but the very purpose of progress.

You are a group of idealistic teenagers caught in the eye of this storm, uncovering a tangled web of **spiritual, political, and technological warfare**. As the **Clockwork Divide** widens, your party may be the last hope to restore balance—or tip the scales toward chaos.

## World Overview

### Snowcrystal
A volatile magical-arcane compound used to power everything from **divine codex reactors** to **mechanized cities**. It glows faintly blue and resonates with spiritual frequencies—capable of fueling miracles or destruction alike.

### Regions (Brief Overview)
- **The Cradle States** – Theocratic-industrial bastions, heart of old civilization.
- **Ashbelt Wastes** – Barren, ruined lands scorched by ancient wars, rumored to hide old machines.
- **Verdant Rise** – Wild frontier of free cities and decentralized communes.
- **The Depths Below** – Subterranean networks and cities powered by unstable Snowcrystal reactors.

##  Key Factions

### The Lumen Accord
A coalition of scholars, technomancers, and arcane engineers who believe in the ethical and philosophical advancement of society through harmonious integration of magic and innovation.

### The Forge Concordat
Industrialist separatists that view progress as a mechanical imperative—divinity is irrelevant; power is productivity.

### Emberveil Collective
A civilian movement formed from former miners, scholars, and dissidents—pushing for decommodification of Snowcrystal and decolonization of ancient lands.

### The Pale Trust
A conglomerate of megacorporations and shadow councils manipulating global economies under the guise of neutrality. No ethics. Only profit.
